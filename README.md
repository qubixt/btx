# BTX Node

BTX is a post-quantum, AI-infrastructure-friendly blockchain derived from
[Bitcoin Knots](https://github.com/bitcoinknots/bitcoin) v29.2. It replaces
Bitcoin's SHA-256d proof of work with **MatMul PoW** — a novel consensus
mechanism based on matrix multiplication over a finite field — adds
**post-quantum transaction signatures** via witness v2 P2MR outputs, provides a
**shielded transaction pool** with lattice-based confidential transactions
active from genesis, enforces reduced-data transaction constraints (BIP
110-style) from genesis, and implements **Dandelion++ transaction relay** (BIP
156) for network-layer anonymity.

This repository contains the full node implementation, wallet, mining
infrastructure, and test suites.

BTX extends the upstream Bitcoin Knots codebase with:

- MatMul proof of work for AI-oriented compute hardware
- witness v2 P2MR outputs for post-quantum signatures
- a native shielded transaction pool
- reduced-data transaction constraints from genesis
- Dandelion++ transaction relay for network-layer privacy

## MatMul Proof of Work

MatMul PoW is an AI-infrastructure-friendly proof of work based on the paper
*"Proofs of Useful Work from Arbitrary Matrix Multiplication"*
(Komargodski, Schen, Weinstein —
[arXiv:2504.09971](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09971), April 2025).

Instead of brute-force hashing, miners perform matrix multiplications over a
Mersenne prime field (q = 2^31 - 1). The core work unit — large dense matrix
multiplication — is the same operation that dominates GPU and TPU workloads for
AI/ML training and inference, making the mining hardware directly reusable for
productive computation.

### How It Works

1. **Seed derivation**: Two deterministic seeds (`seed_a`, `seed_b`) are derived
   from the previous block hash and current height. Miners cannot choose
   favorable matrices.

2. **Matrix generation**: Seeds expand into two n x n matrices (A, B) over F_q.

3. **Noise injection**: A low-rank noise perturbation (rank r) is generated from
   the block header and nonce, producing A' = A + E and B' = B + F. This
   prevents precomputation.

4. **Matrix multiplication**: The miner computes C' = A' x B' — a standard
   dense matrix product.

5. **Transcript hashing**: The result is canonicalized into block-sized chunks,
   compressed with a deterministic vector, and hashed with SHA-256.

6. **Difficulty check**: If the transcript hash meets the target, the block is
   valid.

### Two-Phase Validation

- **Phase 1** (O(1)): Checks header fields, dimension bounds, seed validity,
  and that the digest meets the target. Every node runs this on every block.
- **Phase 2** (O(n^3)): Reconstructs matrices, performs the full multiplication,
  and verifies the transcript hash. Rate-limited to 8 verifications per peer
  per minute. Only applied to recent blocks (last 1000 on mainnet).

From block `61000`, mainnet validation switches to the
product-committed digest path for MatMul proof-of-work hardening. The
historical bootstrap/ASERT/pre-hash mainnet schedule remains frozen at
`50000`; only the newer post-launch hardening activations live at `61000`.
Current protocol and activation details live in
[doc/security/hardfork-61000.md](doc/security/hardfork-61000.md) and
[doc/btx-matmul-pow-spec.md](doc/btx-matmul-pow-spec.md).

### Parameters by Network

| Parameter | Mainnet | Testnet | Regtest |
|---|---|---|---|
| Matrix dimension (n) | 512 | 256 | 64 |
| Transcript block size (b) | 16 | 8 | 8 |
| Noise rank (r) | 8 | 4 | 4 |
| Pre-hash epsilon bits | 10 (18 from block 50 000) | 10 | 10 |
| Validation window | 1000 | 500 | 10 |
| Phase 2 ban threshold | 3 | unlimited | unlimited |

### Block Header

The BTX block header extends Bitcoin's 80-byte header:

```
nVersion        (4 bytes)      Block version
hashPrevBlock   (32 bytes)     Previous block hash
hashMerkleRoot  (32 bytes)     Transaction merkle root
nTime           (4 bytes)      Block timestamp
nBits           (4 bytes)      Difficulty target (compact)
nNonce64        (8 bytes)      64-bit mining nonce
matmul_digest   (32 bytes)     SHA-256 of MatMul transcript
matmul_dim      (2 bytes)      Matrix dimension used
seed_a          (32 bytes)     Deterministic seed for matrix A
seed_b          (32 bytes)     Deterministic seed for matrix B
```

Total serialized header: ~182 bytes.

## Post-Quantum Cryptography

BTX implements **NIST-standardized post-quantum digital signatures** through a
new output type called **P2MR** (Pay-to-Merkle-Root), activated as **witness
version 2**.

### Algorithms

| Algorithm | Role | Pubkey | Signature | Type |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **ML-DSA-44** (Dilithium) | Primary | 1312 bytes | 2420 bytes | Lattice-based |
| **SLH-DSA-SHAKE-128s** (SPHINCS+) | Backup | 32 bytes | 7856 bytes | Hash-based |

BTX keeps ML-DSA-44 as the active primary algorithm today. Falcon-512 is not
enabled yet, but this branch reserves P2MR soft-fork slots for a future Falcon
activation path once implementations, audits, and operational tooling are
mature enough to ship safely.

### P2MR Design

P2MR uses a **hybrid two-leaf Merkle tree**:

- **Primary leaf**: `<1312-byte-pubkey> OP_CHECKSIG_MLDSA` — lattice-based
  ML-DSA-44 signature for everyday transactions.
- **Backup leaf**: `<32-byte-pubkey> OP_CHECKSIG_SLHDSA` — stateless
  hash-based SLH-DSA signature for key-compromise recovery.

The witness program is a 32-byte Merkle root: `OP_2 <merkle-root>`. Addresses
use Bech32m encoding with witness version 2, giving the prefix `btx1z...`.

### Script Opcodes

| Opcode | Function |
|---|---|
| `OP_CHECKSIG_MLDSA` | Verify ML-DSA-44 signature against P2MR sighash |
| `OP_CHECKSIG_SLHDSA` | Verify SLH-DSA-SHAKE-128s signature against P2MR sighash |
| `OP_CHECKSIGADD_MLDSA` | Accumulate ML-DSA signature result for threshold multisig |
| `OP_CHECKSIGADD_SLHDSA` | Accumulate SLH-DSA signature result for threshold multisig |
| `OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY` | Enforce CTV template hash in P2MR leaves |
| `OP_CHECKSIGFROMSTACK` | Verify externally provided message signatures in P2MR leaves |

Reserved for future P2MR soft forks and intentionally left inactive today:

| Reserved Opcode | Current Meaning |
|---|---|
| `OP_CHECKSIG_FALCON` | P2MR `OP_SUCCESS` reservation for future Falcon checksig |
| `OP_CHECKSIGADD_FALCON` | P2MR `OP_SUCCESS` reservation for future Falcon multisig |
| `OP_CHECKSIGFROMSTACK_FALCON` | P2MR `OP_SUCCESS` reservation for future Falcon CSFS/oracle paths |

### Wallet Integration

- **Descriptor format**: `mr(<mldsa-key>,pk_slh(<slhdsa-key>))`, plus CTV/CSFS
  leaf forms `ctv(...)`, `ctv_pk(...)`, `csfs(...)`, and `csfs_pk(...)`
- **Multisig descriptors**: `mr(multi_pq(...))` and `mr(sortedmulti_pq(...))`
- **Timelocked multisig descriptors**: `mr(cltv_multi_pq(...))`,
  `mr(csv_multi_pq(...))`, `mr(ctv_multi_pq(...))`, plus sorted variants
- **Miniscript integration**: P2MR context supports PQ key and threshold fragments
- **HD derivation**: Purpose `87h` for P2MR descriptors
- **Relay policy**: P2MR-only enforcement with watch-only guardrails

## Shielded Pool

BTX includes a **shielded transaction pool** active from genesis on all
networks. Shielded transactions hide sender, receiver, and amount using
lattice-based zero-knowledge proofs, while coinbase rewards are automatically
moved into the shielded pool by default.

### Production Status

The current production architecture is:

- `DIRECT_SMILE` as the default direct `z_sendmany` backend,
- default direct ring size `8`, configurable up to `32` on the current wire
  surface via `-shieldedringsize`,
- wallet-built transparent deposit (`z_shieldcoinbase` and compatible
  coinbase-only `z_shieldfunds` sweeps after `61000`),
  fully shielded direct send, note merge, and mixed shielded-to-transparent
  unshield all running on the `v2_send` transaction family,
- shared-ring `BATCH_SMILE` ingress on the live bridge-in path,
- full account-leaf payloads committed in registry state so future spend
  reconstruction comes from authenticated consensus data,
- lean consumed-leaf transaction witnesses on wire
  (`leaf_index + account_leaf_commitment + sibling_path`),
- egress, rebalance, and settlement flows aligned with the same shielded state
  model,
- legacy MatRiCT and receipt-backed ingress retained only as non-launch
  residual tooling.

The hard-fork launch protocol is final for this chain. Larger recursive CT
anonymity sets are not part of that protocol and are explicitly rejected by
prover and verifier instead of falling back to the old prototype multi-level CT
branch.

Current operator guidance lives in
[doc/btx-shielded-pool-guide.md](doc/btx-shielded-pool-guide.md) and
[doc/security/README.md](doc/security/README.md).

The shielded pool is built on lattice-based confidential transaction protocols
providing:

- **Confidential amounts**: Pedersen-style commitments hide transaction values
- **Ring signatures**: Each spend references a ring of decoy commitments,
  hiding the true input among decoys
- **Range proofs**: Prove output values are non-negative without revealing them
- **Balance proofs**: Cryptographic guarantee that inputs equal outputs plus fees
- **Nullifier-based double-spend prevention**: Each note produces a unique
  nullifier; the global nullifier set prevents replay

### Transaction Types

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
| **Shield** (transparent -> shielded) | Prefork compatibility deposit on proofless `v2_send`; post-`61000` general public-flow `V2_SEND` is retired, with mature-coinbase compatibility retained for miner shielding |
| **Unshield** (shielded -> transparent) | Prefork compatibility unshield on mixed `v2_send`; post-`61000` transparent settlement moves to explicit bridge/egress surfaces |
| **Fully shielded** (shielded -> shielded) | Transfer within the pool on post-fork `DIRECT_SMILE` `v2_send` |

### Auto-Shield Coinbase

When enabled (default: **on**), the wallet automatically shields mature
coinbase outputs into the shielded pool on each new block.

```bash
# Disable auto-shielding (opt-out)
btxd -autoshieldcoinbase=0

# Manual shielding
btx-cli z_shieldcoinbase
```

### Shielded RPCs

| RPC | Description |
|---|---|
| `z_getnewaddress` | Generate a new shielded address |
| `z_listaddresses` | List all shielded addresses in the wallet |
| `z_getbalance` | Shielded balance with optional minimum confirmations |
| `z_gettotalbalance` | Combined transparent + shielded balance |
| `z_listunspent` | List unspent shielded notes |
| `z_sendmany` | Send to shielded recipients and, before `61000`, optionally transparent recipients |
| `z_shieldcoinbase` | Shield mature coinbase outputs into the pool |
| `z_shieldfunds` | Shield transparent UTXOs with automatic chunking; after `61000`, limited to mature coinbase compatibility sweeps |
| `z_mergenotes` | Consolidate many small notes into one |
| `z_viewtransaction` | Decode shielded transaction details (with viewing keys) |
| `z_exportviewingkey` | Export KEM viewing key for auditors |
| `z_importviewingkey` | Import viewing key for watch-only monitoring |

### Selective Disclosure (View Grants)

Transactions can include **CViewGrant** entries that encrypt viewing keys to
designated auditors using ML-KEM. This allows selective transparency for
compliance or audit workflows without compromising privacy for other
participants. Up to 8 view grants per transaction.

For detailed setup and operations, see
[doc/btx-shielded-pool-guide.md](doc/btx-shielded-pool-guide.md).

## Dandelion++ Transaction Relay

BTX implements **Dandelion++** (BIP 156), a privacy-enhancing protocol for
transaction relay that prevents adversaries from linking transactions to their
originating IP addresses.

### How It Works

1. **Stem phase**: The originating node sends the transaction to one randomly
   chosen peer. That peer forwards it to one more peer, creating a random walk
   (~10 hops expected).

2. **Fluff phase**: After stem relaying, a node probabilistically (10% per hop)
   transitions the transaction to standard diffusion relay, making it appear to
   originate from the fluff point.

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Activation Height | Block 250 000 |
| Service Flag | `NODE_DANDELION` (bit 30) |
| Epoch Interval | ~600 s |
| Stem Probability | 90% per hop |
| Relay Destinations | 2 outbound peers per epoch |
| Embargo Timer | Exponential, mean 39 s |

```bash
# Disable Dandelion++ (opt-out, default: enabled)
btxd -dandelion=0
```

For the full protocol specification, see
[doc/dandelion-pp-implementation-spec-v2.md](doc/dandelion-pp-implementation-spec-v2.md).

---

## CTV + CSFS Covenants

P2MR includes covenant and oracle primitives:

- **CTV (`OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY`)**: Template-constrained spends for vaults
  and payment trees.
- **CSFS (`OP_CHECKSIGFROMSTACK`)**: Message-based oracle signatures (ML-DSA-44
  or SLH-DSA-128s) with optional spender CHECKSIG.
- **DoS hardening**: Explicit validation-weight charging for ML-DSA, SLH-DSA,
  and CSFS; 10,000-byte consensus caps for P2MR script elements.

L2 profile: Supported constructions include CTV vaults/payment trees and CSFS
delegation closes. `SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT` (APO) is not implemented.

ZeroMQ 4.0+ (notifications).

### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential cmake pkg-config \

Use the BTX Windows wrapper instead of the older upstream-style Bitcoin Core
instructions:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\contrib\devtools\build-btx-windows.ps1 `
  -InstallDependencies
```

That wrapper bootstraps a short-path standalone `vcpkg`, attempts a
wallet-enabled headless node build, and runs a regtest smoke test after a
successful compile. See
[doc/btx-windows-11-compile-handbook.md](doc/btx-windows-11-compile-handbook.md)
for the step-by-step newcomer handbook and
[doc/build-windows-msvc.md](doc/build-windows-msvc.md) for the full clone to
mining walkthrough.

For native CLI release assembly without Guix, see
`scripts/release/cut_local_release.py` together with
[doc/btx-github-release-automation.md](doc/btx-github-release-automation.md).

## Running a Node

### Fast-Start Validating Nodes

BTX releases are designed to support a fast-start validating-node workflow for
binary users: install a precompiled archive, load the matching rollback
snapshot, and begin using wallet, mining, and service RPCs before a full
historical sync finishes.

The shortest operator path is:

```bash
export GH_TOKEN="$(<github.key)"  # only needed for private GitHub releases

python3 contrib/faststart/btx-agent-setup.py \
  --repo btxchain/btx \
  --release-tag v29.2-btx1 \
  --preset service \
  --datadir="$HOME/.btx"
```

That installer consumes the published `btx-release-manifest.json`, selects the
correct platform archive, verifies the advertised assets, and can immediately
chain into the assumeutxo bootstrap flow. Use `--preset miner` for a pruned,
mining-oriented setup, or `--preset service` for an RPC-oriented node that is
ready to issue `easy` / `normal` / `hard` / `idle` MatMul service challenges
through `listmatmulservicechallengeprofiles`,
`getmatmulservicechallengeplan`, and
`issuematmulservicechallengeprofile`. The planner and profile RPCs now return
`issue_defaults` / `profile_issue_defaults` so agents can round-trip directly
into `getmatmulservicechallenge` or `issuematmulservicechallengeprofile`
without re-deriving difficulty math by hand. Service operators can also watch
`getdifficultyhealth.service_challenge_registry` for shared-registry health,
run `solvematmulservicechallenge` with explicit `time_budget_ms` /
`solver_threads` limits for background clients, and use the stateless final
flag on `verifymatmulserviceproof` / `verifymatmulserviceproofs` when they need
pure verification without local registry lookups. In `--json` mode, the
installer now keeps bootstrap progress on stderr and returns a machine-readable
summary that includes the installed `btxd` / `btx-cli` paths, the generated
fast-start config, and miner-preset handoff commands for
`contrib/mining/start-live-mining.sh`. For private GitHub releases, export one
of `BTX_GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, or `GH_TOKEN` first so the installer can
authenticate the release-asset downloads.

For the full operator flow, see
[doc/btx-download-and-go.md](doc/btx-download-and-go.md),
[doc/assumeutxo.md](doc/assumeutxo.md), and
[contrib/faststart/README.md](contrib/faststart/README.md).

### Starting the Daemon

```bash
# Foreground
./build/bin/btxd

# Background daemon
./build/bin/btxd -daemon

# Testnet
./build/bin/btxd -testnet -daemon

# Regtest (local testing)
./build/bin/btxd -regtest -daemon
```

### Configuration

Create `~/.btx/btx.conf`:

```ini
server=1
listen=1
port=19335

rpcuser=btxrpc
rpcpassword=your_secure_password
rpcport=19334

dbcache=4096
maxmempool=300

## Wallet Operations

### Creating a Wallet

```bash
# Create a new descriptor wallet
btx-cli createwallet "mywallet"
```

Descriptor wallets are required. Default address type is `p2mr`
(`btx1z...`).

### Receiving and Sending

```bash
# Get a new receiving address
btx-cli -rpcwallet=mywallet getnewaddress
# Returns: btx1z...

# Check balance
btx-cli -rpcwallet=mywallet getbalance

# Send BTX
btx-cli -rpcwallet=mywallet sendtoaddress "btx1z..." 1.5

# Shielded balance
btx-cli -rpcwallet=mywallet z_gettotalbalance

# Send to shielded address
btx-cli -rpcwallet=mywallet z_sendmany '[{"address":"btxs1...","amount":1.0}]'
```

### Backup

```bash
# Verify integrity before taking a production backup
btx-cli -rpcwallet=mywallet z_verifywalletintegrity

# Backup wallet file
btx-cli -rpcwallet=mywallet backupwallet "/path/to/backup.dat"

# Preferred: full encrypted bundle archive
btx-cli -rpcwallet=mywallet \
  -stdinwalletpassphrase \
  -stdinbundlepassphrase \
  backupwalletbundlearchive "/path/to/mywallet.bundle.btx"

# Restore from archive
btx-cli -stdinbundlepassphrase \
  restorewalletbundlearchive "restored" "/path/to/mywallet.bundle.btx"
```

### Wallet Encryption

```bash
btx-cli -rpcwallet=mywallet encryptwallet "your_passphrase"
btx-cli -rpcwallet=mywallet walletpassphrase "your_passphrase" 60
btx-cli -rpcwallet=mywallet walletlock
```

For BTX-native treasury, multisig, timelocked recovery, backup, restore, and
AI-safe operating guidance, see
[doc/btx-key-management-guide.md](doc/btx-key-management-guide.md).

## Key Management

BTX's recommended operational model is:

- descriptor wallets only
- P2MR receive/change descriptors
- watch-only coordinators for planning and accounting
- isolated signer wallets or external signers for authorization
- bundle archive backups plus restore drills

## Shielded Transfer Builder

BTX includes a deterministic operator tool for multisig-to-shielded transfer
bundles at:

- `contrib/shielded_transfer_builder.py`

The builder exposes four explicit phases:

1. `plan`
2. `simulate`
3. `execute`
4. `release`

It is intended for large or operationally sensitive transfers where operators
want:

- a canonical JSON bundle containing the exact unsigned PSBT plan
- deterministic destination ordering and transaction ordering
- authoritative fee convergence through `z_fundpsbt`
- exact finalized mempool preflight before broadcast
- controlled input locking during review and execution

After the post-`61000` privacy fork, `z_fundpsbt` remains suitable for
mature-coinbase compatibility deposits but not for arbitrary transparent
ingress; general transparent deposits should use the bridge-ingress surface.

Example:

```bash
python3 contrib/shielded_transfer_builder.py plan \
  --datadir=/path/to/datadir \
  --chain=main \
  --rpcwallet=signer-1 \
  --signer-wallet=signer-1 \
  --signer-wallet=signer-2 \
  --signer-wallet=signer-3 \
  --destination=btxs1...=1000.00000000 \
  --destination=btxs1...=500.00000000 \
  --bundle=/tmp/transfer-bundle.json
```

The builder reports and consumes the following fee-analysis fields from the
daemon:

- `fee_authoritative`
- `required_mempool_fee`
- `estimated_vsize`
- `estimated_sigop_cost`

For the full operator workflow, lock behavior, auth/config lookup order, and
artifact model, see
[doc/shielded-transfer-builder.md](doc/shielded-transfer-builder.md).

## Mining

### Overview

BTX uses MatMul PoW for mining. The built-in solver is available through RPC
for regtest/testnet mining. For production mainnet mining, use
`getblocktemplate` / `submitblock`.

### Regtest Mining (Testing)

```bash
./build/bin/btxd -regtest -daemon
./build/bin/btx-cli -regtest createwallet "miner"
ADDR=$(./build/bin/btx-cli -regtest -rpcwallet=miner getnewaddress)
./build/bin/btx-cli -regtest generatetoaddress 10 "$ADDR"
./build/bin/btx-cli -regtest -rpcwallet=miner getbalance
# -> 200.00000000 (10 blocks x 20 BTX)
```

### Production Mining (getblocktemplate)

```bash
./build/bin/btx-cli getblocktemplate '{"rules": ["segwit"]}'
```

The template includes MatMul-specific fields (`matmul_dim`, `seed_a`,
`seed_b`, `target`). External miners should:

1. Fetch the template via `getblocktemplate`
2. Generate matrices A, B from `seed_a`, `seed_b`
3. Iterate nonces, applying noise and computing the MatMul transcript
4. When the transcript hash meets the target, submit via `submitblock`

### Mining Best Practices

- Keep the node healthy and near tip before mining. `getmininginfo` exposes a
  `chain_guard` section that reports peer count, near-tip peers, and whether
  mining should be paused.
- The chain guard stays conservative around recently active lagging peers, but
  it discounts long-idle stale peers so a few dead outbound connections do not
  pause otherwise healthy mining sessions.
- For normal operation, avoid `connect=`-only peer islands. Prefer normal peer
  discovery plus optional `addnode=` hints so the node can recover from stale
  peer sets on its own.
- If you use the bundled solo-mining helpers, keep enough automatic peer
  capacity available for discovery; the helper restart path now uses
  `-maxconnections=32` by default instead of a tiny connection budget.
- Back up the mining reward wallet together with its descriptors, not just the
  wallet database file.
- Prefer `btxd` / `btx-cli` in scripts and service files.
- If you intentionally drive local solo mining through `generatetoaddress`,
  use a health-aware supervisor instead of a blind shell loop so the miner can
  react to repeated RPC failures or prolonged `chain_guard` pauses.
- For actual idle-time mining, give that supervisor an explicit local idleness
  probe via `--should-mine-command='...'` so chain health alone is not treated
  as permission to keep mining while the machine is busy.

Portable helper scripts for that workflow live in
[`contrib/mining`](contrib/mining):

```bash
# Start a supervised solo-mining loop
contrib/mining/start-live-mining.sh \
  --datadir="$HOME/.btx" \
  --wallet=miner \
  --should-mine-command='/usr/local/bin/btx-should-mine-now' \
  --address-file=/path/to/miner-address.txt

# Back up the mining wallet + descriptors
contrib/mining/backup-wallet.sh \
  --datadir="$HOME/.btx" \
  --wallet=miner
```

### Mining RPCs

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `getmininginfo` | Current mining state, difficulty, algorithm |
| `getblocktemplate` | Block template for external mining |
| `submitblock` | Submit a solved block |
| `generatetoaddress` | Mine N blocks (regtest/testnet) |
| `getnetworkhashps` | Estimated network hash rate |

### Genesis Block Generator

```bash
./build/bin/btx-genesis --timestamp "BTX genesis" --max-tries 200000 --backend cpu
./build/bin/btx-genesis --timestamp "BTX genesis" --max-tries 200000 --backend metal
```

Backend selection: `BTX_MATMUL_BACKEND` (`cpu|metal|mlx|cuda`).

| Shielded | z_sendmany, z_shieldcoinbase, z_getbalance, viewing keys |
| Network | Peer management, banning, network info |
| Raw Transactions | Transaction creation, signing, decoding |

### ZeroMQ Notifications

```bash
btxd -zmqpubhashtx=tcp://127.0.0.1:28332 \
     -zmqpubhashblock=tcp://127.0.0.1:28332
```

## Network Configuration

### Networks

| Network | P2P Port | Chain ID | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mainnet | 19335 | `main` | Production network |
| Testnet | 29335 | `test` | Public test network |
| Testnet4 | 48333 | `testnet4` | Updated test network |
| Signet | 38333 | `signet` | Custom-challenge test network |
| Regtest | 18444 | `regtest` | Local development and testing |

### DNS Seeds (Mainnet)

```
node.btx.tools
```

Current fixed public fallback peers compiled into `chainparamsseeds.h`:

```
146.190.179.86:19335
164.90.246.229:19335
```

### Custom Regtest / Devnet Identity

```bash
./build/bin/btxd -regtest \
  -regtestmsgstart=0a0b0c0d \
  -regtestport=19444 \
  -regtestgenesisntime=1700001234 \
  -regtestgenesisnonce=42 \
  -regtestgenesisbits=2070ffff \
  -regtestgenesisversion=4
```

All nodes in a devnet must use the same override tuple.

### Key Differences from Bitcoin

1. **PoW**: MatMul PoW replaces SHA-256d. Block headers carry `nNonce64`,
   `matmul_digest`, `matmul_dim`, `seed_a`, `seed_b`.
2. **Post-quantum signatures**: Witness v2 P2MR outputs with ML-DSA-44 and
   SLH-DSA via `OP_CHECKSIG_MLDSA` / `OP_CHECKSIG_SLHDSA`.
3. **Shielded pool**: Lattice-based confidential transactions active from
   genesis. Coinbase auto-shield, z_* RPCs, ML-KEM note encryption.
4. **Block time**: 90 s (vs. Bitcoin's 600 s).
5. **Difficulty**: ASERT per-block adjustment from block 0.
6. **Data limits**: BIP 110-style constraints restrict OP_RETURN to 83 bytes
   and scriptPubKey to 34 bytes, preventing inscription-style data.
7. **Halving**: Every 525 000 blocks with 20 BTX initial reward (same 21M cap).
8. **Address format**: HRP `btx`; P2MR `btx1z...`; shielded `btxs1...`.
9. **Dandelion++ relay**: Stem-then-fluff privacy relay (BIP 156) from block
   250 000.

### Upstream Reference

BTX was forked from Bitcoin Knots v29.2:

## Using BTX As A Service Primitive

The RPC surface also supports:

- Difficulty and challenge introspection for external products
- Useful-work rate limiting
- Spam prevention and abuse pricing
- AI endpoint admission control
- Layered "proof of AI" architectures where BTX gates access and a separate
  verifiable inference layer proves model execution
